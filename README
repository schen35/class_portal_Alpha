Test cases:
1. Must have user name, email and password to sign in and sign up for an account.
2. Name, email and password are limited in length
3. Name,email are all unique and case insensitive.
3. @ will be detected to validate an email address
4.(to be added) admin should be able to delete, approve a student
5.(to be added) students can view, enroll, and drop classes
6.(to be added) classes should have an instructor and valid enrollment date.



-----------
Unrosolved issues:
  1. Enrollment function is not ideal, but it's functional. I know it's a pain in the a$$, but it's the best we can do now. Sorry
  2. There might be some problems with authorizations, such as current admin could delete himself. Working on it.
  3. If something weird is going on, don't be afraid, please let us know so it won't suprise you AGAIN.
